# **Cycle GAN Images**

The GAN was trained for 128 epochs on AMD Cloud and the results (generated images) are in this directory. The filenames starting with "real_" are a set of real images from the dataset which contain both cancerous and non-cancerous images. The filenames starting with "fake_" are the set of fake images generated by the generator. The step following the "_" in the filename denotes the iteration step at which the images were generated. Cancerous images were generated from non-cancerous images, and vice versa, as in a Cycle GAN. The generator gen_AB converts cancerous images from non-cancerous ones.
